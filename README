Update-SPSiteCollectionUser.ps1 -- by Eric Wallace <e@ewall.org>, 2013-04-17


.SYNOPSIS
User a user's DisplayName and Email fields in every SharePoint site collection.

Requires SharePoint management snapin.


.NOTES

In SharePoint, each site collection stores its own table of user data. When the
user accounts are updated in Active Directory, SharePoint's User Profile Service
application will automatically update the user profile used by the non-free
features, but only site collections where the user is "active" (i.e. recently
edited something, not just read it) will get updated.

If the user has a name change and their AD account and email address are
it can be disconcerting when one SharePoint page shows their new name and email
while another shows the old one. This script exists to help you quickly update
the old DisplayName and Email fields so the user doesn't worry.

Please read carefully before deciding to use this; it *will* make changes to
your SharePoint user data! (Of course, if you want to "undo" you can just run
the command again and put the old info back in.) So far I have only tested this
with SharePoint 2010.
